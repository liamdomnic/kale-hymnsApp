            Love him or hate him, Martin Seligman
         is arguably the most famous positive
        psychologist on earth. No other psychologist
         h      as ever achieved the kind of dominant
        presence in positive psychology that Seligman
         has. It is difficult to evaluate the work of
        such a legendary figure without being affected
         by the halo effect. I have only two modest
        objectives in this review: (1) assess the scholarly
         merits of Flourish; and (2) critique the
        role of big money in Seligman’s extraordinary
        accomplishments.\n

        \tFlourish begins with an introduction of
        Seligman’s new theory of well-being and a
        summary of a number of exercises and st
        rategies that can be used to boost happi
        ness and
        well-being. The remainder of the book is
        Seligman’s personal account of the rapid
        expansion of positive psychology into m
        ajor domains of human activities from
        education
        and business to medicine and the mili
        tary. In sum, it is a book more about
        the flourishing
        of Seligman’s brand of positive psych
        ology than the positive psychology of f
        lourishing.
        I am not clear about the intended audi
        ence. When Seligman said to his wife: “I
        don’t have an audience in mind,” she r
        eplied by suggesting, “Just write for y
        ourself” (p.
        267). Indeed the book feels like he is
        writing for himself and for his legacy.
        Flourish
        makes for fascinating reading only if o
        ne is interested in entering into the m

        ind and heart
        of a brilliant psychologist, introducin
        g its readers to the fairy-tale world of
        big money, big
        science, big names, and Seligman’s mega
        projects.
